Jump Till You Drop was a mini-project I made over the course of a few days. This mini-platformer is about an astronaut trying to reach the diamond at the end. How many diamonds you currently have also represents how many times you can jump before hitting the ground. Try to jump too much and you lose! Run, jump, and bounce your way through the two stages this game has to offer. 

<p>This project came from a previous repository that contained all 3rd party assets. Most art, music, and sfx files have now been witheld from the repository for redistribution purposes. The following packages are also needed in order to run the project.</p>

<p>All in 1 sprite shader: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/all-in-1-sprite-shader-156513</p>
<p>Coding Jar Advanced Multi-Scene: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/advanced-multi-scene-cross-scene-references-47200#description</p>
